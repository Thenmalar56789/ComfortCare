# ComfortCare 🧸💬

ComfortCare is a simple emotional support web app with a chatbot named Lumi 🤖🌸. It was built as part of the IBM AI and Automation Unpacked Hackathon to help people feel emotionally supported through AI-powered conversations.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Many people experience loneliness, anxiety, or stress in daily life—at school, work, or even at home. ComfortCare aims to provide **a safe, warm, and uplifting virtual friend** to chat with and support them emotionally.

## 🛠️ Features

🌸 AI-powered chatbot named **Lumi** that responds with care and comfort
- 🖥️ Simple web app interface (Home page, Chat page)
- 🎉 Uplifting popup messages during conversations
- ✨ Responsive design with “Talk to Lumi” button for smooth navigation

## 🧠 AI Technology Used

Model: `ibm-granite/granite-3b-code-instruct` from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
- Used the `transformers` and `Flask` Python libraries
- Due to technical limitations, a lighter Granite-based model was used that doesn’t require login or credit card

## 👩‍💻 User Interaction

Users can open the app in a browser, receive a warm welcome, and chat with Lumi about their feelings. Based on their inputs, Lumi responds kindly and sends surprise encouraging popups to uplift their mood.

## 🧪 Future Plans

Although only a basic prototype was created, the plan includes:
- 🧠 Personalized chatbot training

## 📌 Note

Due to technical and credit card restrictions, watsonx.ai was not directly used. Instead, an **open-source IBM Granite model** was integrated following hackathon guidelines.
